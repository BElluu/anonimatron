# Anonimatron [![Maven version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.rolfje.anonimatron/anonimatron.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22com.rolfje.anonimatron%22%20AND%20a:%22anonimatron%22) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/realrolfje/anonimatron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/realrolfje/anonimatron)

Did you ever have that problem where you needed "production data" to find a bug
or do performance tests outside of the clientâ€™s production environment? Are
you worried about protecting that data? Do you add screenshots to your bug
reports? Can you live with surrogate data with the same properties? Then this
tool is for you. 

Running Anonimatron is as simple as downloading, unzipping and running 
`anonimatron.sh` or `anonimatron.bat`.

Please find all documentation, downloads and quickstarts at the 
[Anonimatron official homepage](https://realrolfje.github.io/anonimatron/).

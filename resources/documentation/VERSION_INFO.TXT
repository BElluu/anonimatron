*** Version 1.10.1
- Implements (rudamentary) support for MSSQL Schemas

*** Version 1.10
- Warning: Breaks code which relies on 1.9.3 and earlier as a library.
- New feature: Short lived synonyms. These values are not stored,
  and not consistent between runs. Used to fill unimportant fields
  and reduce the number of stored synonyms. Use with care.

*** Version 1.9.3
- Anonimatron now available as library in maven central, see
  https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.rolfje.anonimatron

*** Version 1.9.2
- New Synonym: HashedSynonym, where the "from" is hashed so that your
  synonym file no longer contains source data.

*** Version 1.9
- New feature: Anonymize files.
- Bumped to Java 1.7
- Implemented suggestions, bugfixes and improvements.

*** Version 1.8
- Moved to Github
- Added release scripts
- Changed versioning to support the new release scripts
- Added SyBase drivers

*** Version 1.7
- Implemented "Dryrun", feature request #3.
  There is now a new command line option "-dryrun" which will make
  Anonimatron go through all it's paces, but without any writes to your
  database. It will even create a synonym file if you want to.

- Implemented "Prefetching", feature request #5.
  If your Anonymizer implements the "Prefetcher" interface, Anonimatron will
  make a pass through the table and feed every value for your column to your
  Anonymizer. This will enable you to collect the characters used in the
  source data, so you can base your generated Synonyms on that. Any strange
  UTF-8 character in your source database can be in your output set now,
  while still being Anonymized. 

- Added "CharacterStringPrefetchAnonymizer" for feature #5.

- Added "Base64StringFieldHandler" to handle writing binary data from and
  to the Synonym XML file.

- Changed the update strategy, Anonimatron now uses a cursor to go through
  a resultset, instead of generating update statements.

- Reduced memory usage and improved performance.  

*** Version 1.6 (and earlier)
The original Anonimatron versions 1.0 to 1.6 were released in rapid
succession. New features and bugfixes were rapidly implemented to support
some people who started using Anonimatron on production systems. This
usage made Anonimatron what it is today:
- 5 Star rating on Sourceforge
- Featured on Softpedia
